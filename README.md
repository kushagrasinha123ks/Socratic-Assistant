# Socratic Chatbot

This repository is a work-in-progress for building a Socratic Chatbot. The repository currently contains two Jupyter notebooks that guide you through creating a synthetic dataset and fine-tuning a model. Additionally, there is a high-level architectural overview provided as a PDF file.

## Repository Overview

- `GenDataset.ipynb`: This notebook contains code and explanations for generating a synthetic dataset that can be used for chatbot training.
  
- `fine_tune_llama2.ipynb`: This notebook provides the code to fine-tune the chatbot using a pre-trained language model with the synthetic dataset.
  
- `architecture_overview.pdf`: A high-level overview of the architecture being developed. This document is still a work-in-progress as we continue to refine the system.
